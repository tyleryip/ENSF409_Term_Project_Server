# ENSF409_Term_Project

Compile all .java files in the src folder where RegistrationAppServer.java is the main class located in com.KerrYip.ServerApplication

Note that all text files for simulated data including courses, students, course offerings, registrations, and prerequisites are included and should not be modified for the program to work properly. Without these textfiles, the program will not run.
